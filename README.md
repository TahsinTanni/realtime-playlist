## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd realtime-playlist
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up the database**
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Create database and run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database with sample data (40 tracks)
npx prisma db seed
```

4. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Open your browser**
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📦 Database Seeding

The application comes with a seed script that populates the database with:
- **40 diverse tracks** across multiple genres (Pop, Rock, Electronic, Classical, Jazz)
- **10 initial playlist items** with varying votes and positions
- Sample data includes artists like Taylor Swift, The Beatles, Daft Punk, Mozart, and Miles Davis

To re-seed the database:
```bash
# Reset database and re-seed
npx prisma migrate reset

# Or just seed without resetting
npx prisma db seed
```

The seed file is located at `prisma/seed.ts` and can be customized to add your own tracks.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- **Next.js 16.1.4** - React framework with App Router and Turbopack
- **React 19.2.3** - UI library with latest features
- **TypeScript 5.x** - Type safety and better DX
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling with JIT compilation
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions
- **@dnd-kit** - Accessible drag-and-drop functionality
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library

**Backend:**
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless API endpoints
- **Prisma 6.19.2** - Type-safe ORM with SQLite
- **Server-Sent Events** - Real-time one-way communication
- **Zod** - Schema validation

**Testing:**
- **Vitest** - Unit testing framework

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE) over WebSockets**
**Decision:** Use SSE for real-time updates instead of WebSockets.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler implementation for one-way server→client communication
- HTTP-based, works through most firewalls and proxies
- Automatic reconnection built into browser EventSource API
- Lower overhead for this use case (no need for bidirectional communication)
- RESTful mutations via HTTP + SSE for updates = clean separation

**Trade-offs:**
- One-way only (client must use separate HTTP requests for mutations)
- No native binary data support (JSON only)

#### 2. **Fractional Indexing for Positions**
**Decision:** Use fractional indexing algorithm for playlist ordering.

**Rationale:**
- O(1) reordering - no need to update all positions
- Efficient database updates - only update moved item
- Supports drag-and-drop between any two items
- No race conditions with concurrent reorders

**Implementation:** Custom `calculatePosition()` function generates positions between neighbors.

#### 3. **SQLite with Prisma**
**Decision:** Use SQLite as the database with Prisma ORM.

**Rationale:**
- Zero configuration - file-based database
- Perfect for development and demo purposes
- Easy to reset and seed
- Prisma provides excellent TypeScript integration
- Simple migration to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production

**Trade-offs:**
- Not suitable for high-concurrency production use
- Limited to single server deployment

#### 4. **Optimistic UI Updates**
**Decision:** Update UI immediately, then sync with server.

**Rationale:**
- Instant feedback for user actions
- Better perceived performance
- SSE ensures eventual consistency across clients

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires error handling for failed mutations
- Potential temporary inconsistency

#### 5. **React Portals for Hover Previews**
**Decision:** Use React portals to render hover previews at document root.

**Rationale:**
- Escapes stacking context issues
- Guarantees preview appears above all other UI elements
- Centered positioning works reliably
- No z-index conflicts

#### 6. **Keyboard Navigation for Search**
**Decision:** Implement full keyboard support for search suggestions.

**Rationale:**
- Accessibility (keyboard-only users)
- Power user efficiency
- Better UX (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Add Tracks**: Search for tracks in the library and click "Add" to add them to the playlist
2. **Reorder**: Drag tracks up or down using the handle icon
3. **Vote**: Use ↑↓ buttons to upvote or downvote tracks
4. **Play**: Click on any track to start playing it
5. **Remove**: Click the ❌ button to remove a track from the playlist
6. **Seek**: Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that position

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space**: Play/Pause the current track
- **←**: Previous track
- **→**: Next track
- **↑/↓**: Navigate search suggestions
- **Enter**: Select highlighted suggestion
- **Escape**: Close suggestions

### Features

- **Auto-Sort**: Toggle the auto-sort button to automatically reorder by votes
- **History**: View recently played tracks (top right button)
- **Export**: Download your playlist as JSON
- **Hover Preview**: Hover over vote buttons to see full track details in a centered modal

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Test files are located alongside their source files (e.g., `calculatePosition.test.ts`).

## Performance Optimizations

- **Optimistic updates** for instant UI feedback
- **Debounced search** to reduce API calls
- **Memoized calculations** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Virtual scrolling ready** (can be added for large playlists)
- **Efficient SSE** with heartbeat and auto-reconnection
- **Fractional indexing** for O(1) reordering

## Security Considerations

- **Input validation** with Zod schemas
- **SQL injection protection** via Prisma ORM
- **XSS prevention** via React's built-in escaping
- **Rate limiting** (recommended for production)
- **Authentication** (not implemented - recommended for production)

## Known Limitations

- **Single server**: SSE manager state is in-memory (use Redis for multi-server)
- **No authentication**: All users share the same playlist
- **No persistence of playback state**: Progress resets on page reload
- **SQLite limitations**: Not suitable for high-concurrency production
- **No offline support**: Requires active internet connection
